### Week 1
Learning outcome. Building a personal and running GitHub Pages.
- Make Lab Notebook rows/columns for each week 0, 1, 2.  Make a hack (IPYNB) and review/exit ticket for each row.   
- Get github.io public site running.  This will work after GitHub sync.
- Work on revising IPYNB file(s) and add in required Hacks.  Learn how to do  “Code Fencing”, “Code Cells”.  
- Revise  Linux Shell  and Python IO IPYNB, prune and perform hacks to match my understanding.
- Revise Home Page to only be a Lab Notebook Cover sheet,  Remove some of the content that I mistakingly put on this page regarding weekly plans and hacks …. move this information into my Lab Notebook rows/columns.
- Work on adding a Project, my choice will be a Calculator and I will add it as an independent _post that will be in Week1 hacks of my Notebook.


### Pair Planning Meeting
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  Review week with Pair and look ahead and start plan for next week.  Try to be done and learn your machine before Monday EOD.
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with ability to operate Development Tools on it or within the Cloud.
- GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal blog: containing notes, answering hacks, and showing tangibles.  Building pages will teach Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Code in your blog.
- Slack Account, install the App on Laptop and/or phone, get used to reading announcements. Slack is the tool that we will use for messaging, we have been averaging 1000s of essages each year.
- VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VSCode is more than and editor, this type of tool is often called an Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 
- Run make commands to build and test blog locally, before pushing changes to GitHub pages.
