## Citizen Science  
- Citizen Science is scientific research that the general population helps to conduct. Ordinary citizens, often non-scientists, help contribute data to research projects using computing devices.
- Gives a wide range of people the ability to contribute to scientific studies which provides more diverse data.
### Popcorn Hack  
How do you believe participating in a citizen science project could enhance both scientific research and public engagement, and can you share any specific areas of scientific study where citizen science might make a significant impact in the future?

# Homework
## Question 1  
Explain the concept of crowdsourcing. Provide examples of how it is commonly used in different fields.

Crowdsourcing involves obtaining work and information from a broad online community. This decentralized approach is widely used across various fields, such as product development, crowdfunding, and open-source software development.

## Question 2  
Discuss the benefits and challenges associated with crowdsourcing. How can organizations effectively harness the power of crowdsourcing while mitigating potential drawbacks?

Crowdsourcing offers diverse perspectives and cost-effectiveness but faces challenges like quality control. To use it effectively, organizations should set clear goals, encourage engagement, ensure quality, provide incentives, and establish a legal framework. Moderation and feedback are key for successful crowdsourcing. Managing these factors helps organizations efficiently achieve goals and solve problems.

## Question 3  
Identify a real-world example of a successful crowdsourcing project. Explain the project, its goals, and the positive outcomes achieved through the collaboration of a large group of people.

An example of a successful crowdsourcing project is the "Foldit" game by the University of Washington. In Foldit, players solve protein-folding puzzles to aid disease research and drug development. The game has led to significant scientific discoveries, with players solving complex problems more effectively than computers. Foldit demonstrates how crowdsourcing can accelerate research and engage a community in addressing real-world challenges.

### Question 4
Create a hypothetical scenario where crowdsourcing could be applied to solve a specific problem. Describe the problem, the type of contributions you would seek from the crowd, and the potential impact of implementing the crowdsourced solution.

A city dealing with traffic problems uses crowdsourcing to gather ideas from residents and experts on improving public transportation. They seek innovative solutions for better routes, real-time tracking, and eco-friendly options. By involving the community, the city aims to enhance urban living with less congestion and shorter commutes.
