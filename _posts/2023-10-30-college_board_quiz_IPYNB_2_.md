## 23. Redundant routing with four computers

### Correct Answer: B
Redundant routing is impossible if there is only one possible path from one device to another. There is only one possible path from P to S (P to R to Q to S).

My Answer: C
There are multiple paths from P to S (for example, P to S and P to Q to S).

## 24. Compression By Replacing TH and IS with characters

Byte pair encoding is a data encoding technique. The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters that appear in the string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a corresponding character that does not appear in the string. The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.

For example, the "THIS_IS_THE_BEST_WISH" can be encoded as "%#_#_%E_BEST_W#H" by replacing all instances of "TH" with "%" and replacing all instances of"IS" with "#".

Which of the following statements about byte pair encoding is true?

A. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossy transformation because it discards some of the data in the original string.

B. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossy transformation because some pairs of characters are replaced by a single character.

C. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored to its original version.

D. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because it can be used to transmit messages securely.

### Correct Answer: C

The transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version

My Answer: B
This option is incorrect. While some pairs of characters of the original string are replaced in the encoded string with a single character, this transformation is not lossy because the original version can be restored.




## 37. Comparing code segments to compute average from list

### Correct Answer: C

Both code segments display the correct average

My Answer: B
Code segment I also displays the correct average.



## 40 Computer science midterm and final grades

Grades in a computer science course are based on total points earned on a midterm exam and a final exam. The teacher provides a way for students to improve their course grades if they receive high scores on the final exam: if a student’s final exam score is greater than the student’s midterm exam score, the final exam score replaces the midterm exam score in the calculation of total points.

The table below shows two students’ scores on the midterm and final exams and the calculated total points each student earns.

A table is shown with 4 columns and 3 rows. The first row of the table contains the column headers, from left to right, Student Name, Midterm Exam Score, Final Exam Score, Total Points Calculation. The table is as follows: Khalil, 90, 80, 90 plus 80 equals 170 Josefina, 70, 90, 90 plus 90 equals 180

Khalil does better on the midterm exam than on the final exam, so his original midterm and final exam scores are added to compute his total points.
Josefina does better on the final exam than on the midterm exam, so her final exam score replaces her midterm exam score in the total points calculation.
The teacher has data representing the scores of thousands of students. For each student, the data contain the student name, the midterm exam score, the final exam score, and the result of the total points calculation. Which of the following could be determined from the data?

I. The average total points earned per student
II. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy
III. The proportion of students who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy

### Correct Answer: D

The average total points earned per student can be determined using the result of the total points calculation
for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by
calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. The proportion of students
who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by comparing the midterm and final scores for each student with the result of the total points calculation.



## 42. Increasing bit representation for internet protocol

Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) represents each IP address as a 32-bit binary number. Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents each IP address as a 128-bit binary number. Which of the following best describes the result of using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses?

### Correct Answer: D

With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2^32 possible addresses. With 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2^128 possible addresses. Sinse 2^32 x 2^96 = 2^128, IPv6 has 2^96 times as many possible addresses as IPv4.


## 43. Runtime of algorithm for online retailer

An online retailer uses an algorithm to sort a list of n items by price. The table below shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to sort lists of different sizes.

A table is shown with 2 columns and 7 rows. The first row of the table contains the column headers, from left to right, Number of Items, Number of Steps. The table is as follows: 10, 100 20, 400 thirty, 900 forty, 1,600 fifty, 2,500 sixty, 3,600

Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for very large values of n?

### Correct Answer A

The pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n^2 steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time


## 45. NAND logic gate

A NAND gage is a type of logic fate that produces an output of false only when both of its two inputs are true. Otherwise, the gate produces an output of true. Which of the following Boolean expressions correctly models a NAND gate with inputs P and Q?

### Correct Answer: C

The expression P and Q evaluates to true when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to false otherwise. Therefore, the expression NOT (P AND Q) evaluates to flase when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to true otherwise
