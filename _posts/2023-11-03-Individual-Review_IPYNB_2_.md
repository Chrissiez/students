# Individual Code 

## Chrissie's Cookies

this is the main group project
Since I was going into this project with no previous coding experience, it was difficult to add useful commits. So instead, I spent time learning from what my teammates coded and adding my own additions.

### Our Story Page - layouts

link to [issue](https://github.com/Vynz123/chrissieccookies/commit/7847066759729d7a71f3bda7e7b1c93006edf365)

Very early on, there was a plan to have a Story/Media Page. So, I referred to the already set up home page and set up a page for our story. 

I first copied the layout of the catalog.html and made a new .md. Then I changed the site base url for all of the layouts so it would include the story page. Then I refreshed on how to add text in html

### Adding Cookies - Api

Once Harkirat set up the backend API. I started to learn how to add data to the API. I followed Harkirat's code to add a Cookie 8. Then he showed me how to view and access the data through postman.

## Dino Game 

This is a side project I did with Arushi

Since we weren't as advanced as the other members in our group, we had difficulty adding meaningful commits. So, we decided to create our own side project.

## Student Lessons

Student Lessons are organized chronologically and in a separate column. I make sure to complete all hacks and do all the homework to make the most out of the student lessons. I try to show as much effort as possible, especially in the homework.

## Pseudo Code

DISPLAY ("What's your name?")
name <- INPUT ()
DISPLAY ("Hello")
DISPLAY (name)
Pseudo code lets you draft code before it’s written. Here, there’s code to display your name with user input. 

I think pseduo code is pretty useful and beginner friendly considering you don't have remember to add <> or ; after each line of code like in html and javascript.

## Analytics

## Reflection

I learned a lot new skills over the course of this trimester. I feel like there was a massive learning curve, but hopefully I will start picking up on things quicker in the next two trimesters. I learned a lot about markdown, javascript, python, html, CSS, github, and linux bash and shell. I feel like I'm starting to understand markdown, css, and python more, but I feel like I still don't really understand linux bash and sheel and js 

Not only did I expand my knowledge coding-wise, but I also now know what kind of group I should be looking for. Orginally, I assumed joining a group of people who were more experienced would be more beneficial since they could teach me. But I quickly found that it was actually harder for me to learn, as a lot of the coding would be done at home and without any information on how they did it.
