# Individual Code 

## Chrissie's Cookies

this is the main group project
Since I was going into this project with no previous coding experience, it was difficult to add useful commits. So instead, I spent time learning from what my teammates coded and adding my own additions.

### Our Story Page - layouts

Very early on, there was a plan to have a Story/Media Page. So, I referred to the already set up home page and set up a page for our story. 

I first copied the layout of the catalog.html and made a new .md. Then I changed the site base url for all of the layouts so it would include the story page. Then I refreshed on how to add text in html

### Adding Cookies - Api

Once Harkirat set up the backend API. I started to learn how to add data to the API. I followed Harkirat's code to add a Cookie 8. Then he showed me how to view and access the data through postman.

## Dino Game 

This is a side project I did with Arushi

Since we weren't as advanced as the other members in our group, we had difficulty adding meaningful commits.
